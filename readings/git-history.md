# Explore Git History

By now, you've learned a little bit about the mechanics of making commits,
and how to write good commits messages. But one question we haven't answered,
and one you may be wondering about, is "Why are we creating commits in the
first place?". It's well and good to say that we're creating different
'versions' of our project... but what does that actually mean?

## `git log`

One major reason why we make commits is to have documentation on what we were
working on, when we were working on it, and why we made the decisions we made.
This is important in case a developer who is not intimately familiar with the
project, such as a coworker (or yourself after about a month's absence) needs to
pick up on the project where you've left off. Having lots of commits also allows
you to break your work apart very granularly, so that you can see exactly where
and when a particular change was introduced.

To see the full history of the repository, we can use the command `git log`.

The output from running `git log` usually looks something like this:

```bash
commit c66f4434200720269ca82a6dff817e0a93763949
Author: Boaty McBoatface <btmcbtfc@gee-mail.com>

    Remove unnecessary test

    Create boilerplate

commit 402fe7563abf99a11bef06a3f659ad00de2209e6
Author: Boaty McBoatface <btmcbtfc@gee-mail.com>
Date:   Sat Mar 15 10:31:28 2008 -0700

    First commit
```

That number after the word 'commit' is a unique identifier for that commit. It
is generated by an secure hash algorithm, or SHA, so it is commonly referred to
as the commit's "SHA code" or "SHA number". The 'author' is the user that is
currently registered by Git; when you're working alone, this will always be you,
but when you collaborate you may see commits from lots of other people.

There are a lot of different **option flags** that we can use (and combine) to
customize our `git log` command. Here's a short list of some useful ones.

| Flag        | What It Does                                                                      |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-n`        | Show the last 'n' commits; e.g. `git log -n 3`. Also can be written `-3`          |
| `-p`        | Show the each commit's actual changes in addition to commit messages.             |
| `--stat`    | Show stats _about_ each commit's changes (not the changes themselves).            |
| `--oneline` | Display only the subject line and a shortened numeric SHA code                    |
| `--since`   | Show all commits made since a certain date ('YYY-MM-DD', optionally with a time). |
